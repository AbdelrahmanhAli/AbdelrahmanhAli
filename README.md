# Hey there! 👋 I’m Abdelrahman Hamdy

I’m a **backend developer** who thrives on building robust, scalable systems that power the digital world. With a love for clean code and a knack for solving complex problems, I specialize in crafting APIs and microservices that don’t just work—they *excel*.

## What I Do 🚀
- **Backend Magic**: I wield **Django** and **Django REST Framework (DRF)** to create secure, high-performance APIs that scale effortlessly. From authentication flows to database optimization, I’ve got it covered.
- **DevOps Enthusiast**: I tame the chaos with **Docker**, **Kubernetes**, **AWS**, and **CI/CD pipelines** (think GitHub Actions, Jenkins). Deployments? Smooth as butter.
- **Python professional**: Python is my weapon of choice—elegant, powerful, and perfect for everything from web apps to automation scripts.
- **API Architect and System Scaler**: I design architectures that handle growth uisng different techniques and tools, whether it’s a startup MVP or a thousands-user platform.
